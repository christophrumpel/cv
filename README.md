# Christoph Rumpel CV

Hey, I'm Christoph and this is my story. Not all of it, but everything work-related. I am not a fan of the traditional CVs with all kind of unnecessary information. 👎🏼
This is why I provide everything you need to know about me here. What place could be more appropriate for this than GitHub? 😅 If there's anything else you'd like to know I´d be happy to chat with you over a beer.

*Note: If you don't like Emojis, this will be hard for you*

2016 I started to give meetup talks in Vienna. 2017 I spoke a lot about chatbots in meetups as well as on several small to medium conferences like the WebCamp in Zagreb or the Christmage in Aachen.
Checkout this [video](https://youtu.be/DbSNTjLszsM) of my last talk in Zagreb / Croatia or my [website](http://christoph-rumpel.com/talks) for more details on my talks.

## Specialization 🖖🏼

Since 2016 I have spent most of my time at Liechtenecker working with chatbots. Lichtenecker is among the few companies who already built several chatbots for Austrian companies. Besides Facebook and Slack we also developed custom chatbots and chatbot interfaces for website integrations.
As I mentioned earlier I also did several talks on my experiences on this topic so far and I am currently writing the book "[Build Chatbots with PHP](https://christoph-rumpel.com/build-chatbots-with-php)".
